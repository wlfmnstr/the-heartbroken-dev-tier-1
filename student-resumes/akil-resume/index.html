          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>
            I spent the first 2.5 years of my career in growth marketing &
            demand generation. After my brief stint in B2B SaaS, I came across
            an opportunity to work on a project with a few friends and ended up
            founding Root Catalyst. Here, we're building a product that
            streamlines property transactions in the Indian Real Estate space.
          </p>

          <p>
            After leading the operations function for 8 months now, I realized
            wanting to be technically competent enough to develop a product (the
            MVP at least) on my own. Here I am, trying to build something
            already.
