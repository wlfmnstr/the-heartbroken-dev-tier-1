        <p><strong>Incorporating Economies of Scale(EoS) in Top-down Pavement Management Systems</strong> | Prof: A. Medury and Prof. K. V. Harish <br>
        <em>M.Tech Thesis; Publication under review in ASCE Journal of Infrastructure Systems, a leading journal in infrastructure asset management</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Proposed <strong>new non-convex optimization</strong> model for pavement management that accounted for EoS in decision making along with pavement deterioration, maintenance interventions <em>(domain knowledge)</em> over the life cycle of the system-wide pavement network </li>
            <li>Efficiently solved the problem by <strong>Sigmoidal Programming</strong> (branch & bound method, theoretical global optimality guarantees, consumes less processing & more RAM) & a <strong>piecewise linearisation heuristic</strong> (approximate solution for bounds, CPLEX solver). <br> Demonstrated algorithmic efficiencies; maintenance decisions changes & associated <strong>cost savings</strong> from <strong>10%-45%</strong> for different EoS</li>
            <li>Explored various other problem formulations <strong>(LP, IP, MILP, SOCP etc)</strong>, their theoretical backgrounds and solution methods <strong>(B&B, cutting planes, valid inequalities, heuristics, gradient based methods, neural nets, deep reinforcement learning)</strong></li>
